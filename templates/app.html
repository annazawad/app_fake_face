    <p>
        Fake face image recognition Application detects the face using Haar Cascade and predicts if
        this face belongs to real existing person.
        Image Classification is based on Convolutional Neural Network algorithm.
        Model was trained on few thousands of images presenting real or fake people.
    </p>
    <p> If you want to check if the picture presents real person or just creature generated by AI algorithms, just upload the image of person.
        Application is limited to detect only one face but can be extended to detect
        all several faces present in the picture.
